        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility &#xA;modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. &#xA;Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."

        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"

        message="A newer version of com.android.tools.build:gradle than 3.1.4 is available: 3.2.1"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

        message="Avoid using + in version numbers; can lead to unpredictable and unrepeatable builds (com.facebook.react:react-native:+)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Gradle Dynamic Version"
        explanation="Using `+` in dependencies lets you automatically pick up the latest available version rather than a specific, named version. However, this is not recommended; your builds are not repeatable; you may have tested with a slightly different version than what the build server used. (Using a dynamic version as the major version number is more problematic than using it in the minor version position.)"
